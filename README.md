# CVE_Assessment_03_2019
This is a review of Harmon.ie  which identifies vulnerabilities related to windows registry, security settings, and network connections.

Adversaries could use a combination of these vulnerabilities to obtain unauthorized access through information gathering (discovery) techniques and mechanisms to bypass user account controls. 

The main components reviewed included dynamic link libraries (DLL) and executable files (EXE). The findings show vulnerabilities related to the use of deprecated libraries, suspicious files, executable installer (compiler), and required privilege to install the software.
